# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-in-Python

In this project I implements the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm using the pyswarms library that can be found here: https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms and installed as

`pip install pyswarms`

This project contains three visualisations of the algorithm working its magic. There are two files, on for 2D animations and one for 3D. Different files also optimize different functions. Here is PSO with a sphere functions in 2D:

And here is PSO with a Schaffer 2 function in 3D
